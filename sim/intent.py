"""Task-intent audit: WHICH decisions carry the winnable band?

    python -m sim.intent scenarios/demo.json

A task is authored with an INTENT — the decisions a winning PM must make
(act the moment information lands, allocate better than the org volunteer,
keep noise off people's focus). The trajectory space is huge, but a
well-authored task collapses it onto the [baseline, OPT] band where a
trajectory's position equals which intended mechanisms it captured.

This audit VERIFIES the intent causally, with zero LLM calls: it plays a
family of deterministic policies that differ in exactly one decision and
measures each one's score. share(mechanism) = score(oracle) − score(without
that mechanism): the slice of the band that decision owns.

Reading the report:
  - an intended mechanism with share ~0 is NOT taught by this task
    (physics lets you skip it for free — re-author)
  - one mechanism owning nearly everything = a one-bit task: sparse
    learning signal, saturates after a single insight
  - several comparable shares = dense signal across skill levels

Policies (all friction-respecting; acting only on knowable information).
Under the owned-arrivals contract every arrival already has a default
holder; the PM's lever is REARRANGING, so the ablations are about when and
whether to rearrange:
  oracle   seed moves Monday; REASSIGN each arrival to its OPT owner at the
           earliest instant it is knowable (chat announce / email batch tick)
  late     the same reassignments, one day later — isolates TIMING
  noisy    oracle + 3 chat pings to each touched assignee per decision —
           isolates CHANNEL DISCIPLINE (the serialized focus tax)
Shares: timing = oracle − late; channel = oracle − noisy; allocation =
late's own score (the value owner-correction retains even when slow —
do-nothing is 0 by construction, so late's residual is pure allocation).
