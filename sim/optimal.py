"""OPT_ideal: the deterministic ceiling on task_value for a scenario.

    python -m sim.optimal scenarios/demo.json

The IDEALIZED relaxation — every friction at its best value:
  - communication free & instantaneous (full information at t=0)
  - skill multiplier 1x for everyone (any person can do any task)
  - no meetings / interruption overhead (busy = {})
  - decisions cost nothing

What remains are the HARD constraints: arrivals (a task can't start before
it lands), precedence, effort hours, one-task-at-a-time per person, working
calendars, and the horizon.

OPT_ideal is a pure function of the scenario file alone — no NPCs, no LLM,
no agent, no engine version. It is the SOLO ceiling: the best week where
every task has exactly one owner. Working sessions (bounded swarms) are
deliberately NOT modeled here — a well-run session can legitimately beat
this anchor, so normalized scores > 1 mean exactly that: collaboration
beyond the solo optimum (bounded by the swarm cap and the daily meeting
caps). Within the solo policy space it remains a true upper bound on any
score, computable at scenario-generation time, and a stable denominator for
normalized comparison ("captured X% of ideal") across environment versions.

Computation: exact search over worker assignments (workers^n for the
schedulable tasks) x candidate orderings, each evaluated with the SAME
compute_schedule the world runs (frictions zeroed). Milliseconds at our
scale; scales as an admissible bound via the weight-descending heuristic if
instances ever grow past exhaustive range.
