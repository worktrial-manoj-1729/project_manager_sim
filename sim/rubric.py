"""Rubric loading + the dense task-value score.

A rubric is a separate, versioned artifact under rubrics/, referenced by the
scenario ("rubric": "rubrics/demo.json"). Engines copy it into the run dir so
recorded runs stay self-contained and re-gradeable forever.

task_value = the scheduling objective itself:

    value(task) = w_priority x (progress + alpha*done) / (1 + alpha)

summed over AUTHORED tasks only (seed + external; agent-created tasks carry
zero weight — guard against add-fake-tasks reward hacking). Fully
deterministic: a pure function of derived task state at the horizon.
