"""Project/task world model: analytic work-calendar scheduling.

Task progress is a PURE FUNCTION of (task list, logged mutations, sim time) —
no ticks. Tasks arrive three ways: seeded in the scenario (arrival = sim
start), injected on a schedule by external beats (OOD arrivals), or added by
the agent for tracking. Every arrival is a logged `task_added` mutation, so
rewind/replay reconstruct the board at any time.

Scheduling semantics (deterministic, PREEMPTIVE, work-conserving):
- Each assignee works one task at a time, only during working hours
  (Mon-Fri 09:00-17:30).
- A task is READY once it has arrived, somebody holds it
  (max(arrival, assigned_at)), and its blockers are done.
- At every instant each person works their highest-priority ready task
  (urgent -> priority -> creation order, with the PM's timestamped
  `order_events` applied forward-only). When that changes — a higher-priority
  task arrives or unblocks, or a reprioritization fires — they SWITCH; the
  paused task keeps its accrued work and resumes exactly where it stopped.
- Tasks without an assignee or effort are "tracking" items: visible on the
  board, never scheduled.
